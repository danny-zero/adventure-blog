Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow.

We'll put a happy little bush here. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. You can do anything your heart can imagine. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.

It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Very easy to work these to death. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. You can get away with a lot. Let's put a touch more of the magic here.
