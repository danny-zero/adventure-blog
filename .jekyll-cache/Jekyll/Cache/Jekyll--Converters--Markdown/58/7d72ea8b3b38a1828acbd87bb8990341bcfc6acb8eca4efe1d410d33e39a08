I"Å<p>Iâ€™m the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I donâ€™t know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still donâ€™t know why. Youâ€™ve swallowed a planet! Noâ€¦ Itâ€™s a thing; itâ€™s like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>

<p>You know when grown-ups tell you â€˜everythingâ€™s going to be fineâ€™ and you think theyâ€™re probably lying to make you feel better?
Itâ€™s a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as Iâ€™ve always known him: Jeff. Theyâ€™re not aliens, theyâ€™re Earthâ€¦liens! You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>

<p>I hate yogurt. Itâ€™s just stuff with bits in. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as Iâ€™ve always known him: Jeff.</p>

<p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so donâ€™t lie to me! No, Iâ€™ll fix it. Iâ€™m good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, Iâ€™m the Doctor. Donâ€™t call me the Rotmeister.</p>

<p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.â€¦hey.â€¦the good things donâ€™t always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things donâ€™t necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Saving the world with meals on wheels.</p>
