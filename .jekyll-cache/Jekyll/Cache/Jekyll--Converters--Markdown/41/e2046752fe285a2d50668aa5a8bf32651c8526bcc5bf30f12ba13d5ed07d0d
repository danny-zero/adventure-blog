I"Ð<p>Mix your color marbly donâ€™t mix it dead. Maybe thereâ€™s a happy little bush that lives right there. Isnâ€™t that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Nothingâ€™s gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll put a happy little bush here. You donâ€™t have to be crazy to do this but it does help. You can do anything your heart can imagine. But theyâ€™re very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s beautiful - and we havenâ€™t even done anything to it yet. Very easy to work these to death. Now, weâ€™re going to fluff this cloud. You can get away with a lot. Letâ€™s put a touch more of the magic here.</p>
