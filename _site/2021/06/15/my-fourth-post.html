        <p>I’m the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don’t know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don’t know why. You’ve swallowed a planet! No… It’s a thing; it’s like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>

<p>You know when grown-ups tell you ‘everything’s going to be fine’ and you think they’re probably lying to make you feel better?
It’s a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I’ve always known him: Jeff. They’re not aliens, they’re Earth…liens! You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>

<p>I hate yogurt. It’s just stuff with bits in. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I’ve always known him: Jeff.</p>

<p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don’t lie to me! No, I’ll fix it. I’m good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I’m the Doctor. Don’t call me the Rotmeister.</p>

<p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don’t always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don’t necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Saving the world with meals on wheels.</p>
